// include/strata/ds41/engram_rows.hpp - the engram rows of one step, read without the OS file cache.
//
// The two engram tables are about 101 GB each and a step reads only 24 rows of each (256 weight bytes and 8 scale
// bytes per row). Plain preads would leave those pages in the OS file cache, where they push out the routed experts
// that M4 keeps there. So the rows are read with upstream's DirectFile (O_DIRECT, a thread pool, many reads in
// flight), as upstream reads its n-gram table. Where the file system refuses O_DIRECT (tmpfs, some overlays), the
// reader falls back to plain preads and says so once.
