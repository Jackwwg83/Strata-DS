// include/strata/ds41/lookahead.hpp - router lookahead: warm the next layer's experts in the file cache
// (upstream docs/DETAILS.md, "A RAM budget": "while the CPU works on a layer, a thread applies the next layer's
// router to this layer's input and asks the OS for the pages of the predicted experts that neither the GPU nor the
// RAM budget holds").
//
// Only pages are requested (madvise MADV_WILLNEED); the experts computed are the ones the GPU router picks, so the
// output does not change. The prediction is a guess: layer l+1's real input differs from layer l's. The engine
// counts how many of the warmed experts were then used (`useful`), so the guess is judged by measurement.
