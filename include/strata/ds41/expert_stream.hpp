// include/strata/ds41/expert_stream.hpp - prefill's expert stream (upstream's Stager, issuer and ring:
// src/prefill/prefill.cpp, struct Stager and the D-5 issuer thread).
//
// Prefill computes every routed expert on the GPU. Experts that are not in the VRAM tier are copied into a ring of
// device slots while the GPU computes earlier ones. Three roles, each waiting only for what it needs:
//   - reader threads take the jobs in order and put job j's bytes into pinned host buffer j % host_buffers (pread
//     from the pack, or nothing when the expert is in the RAM tier: its slot is pinned already); a buffer is
//     refilled once the DMA of the job before it in that buffer is done;
//   - the issuer thread copies job j into ring slot j % slots on its own copy stream, in order, once the job is read
//     and job j - slots is released; the slot's reuse waits on the GPU (cudaStreamWaitEvent on the consumer's
//     "used" event), not on the host;
//   - the consumer waits on the host only until job j's copy is issued, and makes its stream wait for the copy on
//     the GPU (wait); release records that its stream is done with the slot.
//
// File cache: an expert whose pages were all cached before the read stays cached. An expert read (at least in part)
// from the SSD is dropped from the cache after the copy (posix_fadvise DONTNEED): one prefill streams the whole
// 190 GB file, and keeping it would push out the experts that decode reads from the cache.
