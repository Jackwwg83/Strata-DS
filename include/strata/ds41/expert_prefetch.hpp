// include/strata/ds41/expert_prefetch.hpp - decode prefetch of the next layer's experts.
//
// While layer l computes, layer l+1's router applied to layer l's expert input guesses layer l+1's experts (upstream's
// router lookahead, docs/DETAILS.md, here on the GPU). The guesses outside VRAM that the RAM tier holds are copied to
// a VRAM buffer, one per layer parity. The guesses and the copy run on a stream of their own, beside layer l's shared
// expert, its experts and the wait for the CPU: on the main stream they cost 32 + 10 us per layer and the copy waited
// for layer l's experts (RTX 5090 Laptop, nsys, 2026-10-10). When layer l+1 routes, a miss that was guessed is
// computed by the GPU from the buffer (the doorbell's publish gets the guessed ids and their descriptors), so its
// copy is off the critical path.
// DMA mode: the copy kernel reads host memory with SM loads and slows every main-stream kernel while it runs (about
// 190 us per layer at 4 guesses). In DMA mode the plan writes the copy list to mapped host memory instead; a host
// thread copies it with the copy engine (28.7 GB/s on the laptop's PCIe 5.0 x8) and then raises a flag, which a
// one-thread kernel on main waits for before the layer's experts (as the doorbell's wait).
// Measured on SAGE 1.59bpw (RTX 3090 box, DS41_PREDICT_STATS): 9 guesses hold 77-79% of the misses, 6 hold 66%.
// Everything is enqueued on the device (capturable): no host wait.
